# HCCEngineeringSociety Website:  https://hccengineeringsociety.club/

This repository contains files for the HCC Engineering Society's web site.    The Engineering Society is a club at the Brandon campus of Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida.

This website is one of things the Engineering Society is working on.   The club sponsors a programming workshop that meets in Discord.   In Discord, you look for the programming channel for the Engineering Society.   We meet from 9:30 am to 10:30 on most Fridays.   But feel free to talk to us on our channel.

Currently the website is in a developmental stage.   It is running on a virtual machine hosted by Digital Ocean.
The site uses the Flask web application framework (https://flask.palletsprojects.co).  It is deployed on a VM Digital Ocean.   It uses WSGI (https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to communicate to an NGINX (https://www.fullstackpython.com/nginx.html) webserver.

The plan is gradually build up the website while learning Flask, Python, Jinja, Linux, git commands, HTML, and CSS.   We will to coordinate our efforts through GitHub.   You can find a repository for the website here:
